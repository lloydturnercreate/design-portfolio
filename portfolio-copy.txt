I’m writing this as if it will go straight onto your site (lloydturner.co.uk), so it’ll be production-ready:
clear, premium, confident, and aimed squarely at fintech & Web3 founders / product leaders and agency directors.

💥 FULL DRAFT CONTENT
1. Hero

Headline:

Ex-Google, Ex-MoonPay Senior Product Designer helping fintech & Web3 teams ship investor-grade products.

Subline:

2. Credibility Strip

Trusted by teams at:
🟢 Google 🟢 Amazon 🟢 MoonPay 🟢 Phuture 🟢 Raptor 🟢 Others in fintech & SaaS

3. The Value Section — Why People Hire You

Headline:

Clarity and confidence for teams moving fast.

Body:
Design moves too slowly when products scale quickly.
I work with ambitious teams who need a senior design partner that can:

Systemise design for scale — design systems that speed development and cut inconsistency.

Translate complex products into clean, high-trust experiences that improve activation and retention.

Collaborate directly with founders and PMs to ship investor-ready products fast.

If you’re building in fintech, Web3 or SaaS, I bridge the gap between messy MVP and scalable product design.

4. Case Study Snapshots

Phuture — Launch-Ready Investment App
Built Phuture’s trading interface and design system, reducing onboarding friction and enabling faster product rollouts post-Series A.

Raptor — Design System for Fintech API Platform
Created a unified design system that cut design-to-dev handoff time by 40% and improved cross-product consistency.

MoonPay — Scale Through Systemisation

⚡ Notes on Tone & Execution

Tone: direct, minimal, precise — avoid “creative” fluff, speak like a partner.

Typography: keep it neutral (Inter / Neue Haas / Satoshi), white space heavy.

Use short paragraphs, 2–3 lines max.

Limit visuals to 3–4 strong hero images and one simple process graphic.

Each section should feel like a slide in a sales deck — crisp, declarative, high signal.

📈 Optional Variants for A/B Testing

Alt Hero Option (more business-led):

I help fintech & Web3 startups design systems and interfaces that scale from MVP to Series A.
